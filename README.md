# Maestro

Maestro is a lightweight process orchestrator focused on cloud pipelines, the idea of building Maestro came from our team experience of using other orchestration tools, like [step functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) and [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org), they all offers an incredible set of useful features, but also with some tradeoff.

Maestro is built with [golang](https://golang.org) which provides a great performance and reliability for our project.
